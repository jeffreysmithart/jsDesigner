					<p class="hide-for-medium-up"><strong>I'm Jeffrey Smith &mdash; a front-end web developer with a sensitivity for design.</strong></p> 
					<p>I believe good design is the result of good planning.<br /> I think <em>really</em> good planning occurs when the design and development process are integrated and complement each other.</p>
					<p>I have a passion for learning and problem solving. I think it's my innate curiosity that drives me to try and understand how web technologies work, or why a layout is successful.</p>
					<p>I come from a background as a classically trained painter. Jeffrey also has a love of craft. From a work of art to a line of code, I think <em>how</em> something is constructed contributes to the meaning behind <em>why</em> it was constructed.</p>
					<p>
					This spring I will be graduating from MCTCâ€™s web and interactive media program. I am ready for new challenges and excited to continue to learn as part of a dynamic team.</p> 

<p>Please feel free to connect with me.</p>
